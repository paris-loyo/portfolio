![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)

This project analyzes the 2024 Cyclistic bike-share data to uncover insights about user behavior, such as ride durations, patterns by day of the week, time of day, and month, with comparisons between casual and member riders.

The case study was built in **R** and includes data cleaning, transformation, exploration, and visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this case study is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Cyclistic bike-share data. This includes:

- Cleaning and transforming the raw data
- Visualizing usage patterns
- Comparing behaviors between rider types
- Generating actionable insights for business decisions

---

## 📂 Data Source

The data is sourced from Cyclistic’s public bike-share system and covers 12 months of ride data. All data was downloaded in `.csv` format, then cleaned and processed using R.

---

## 📁 Files in This Repository

### `01_load_and_combine_data.R`
Performs:

- Data loading and combining from multiple CSVs
- Column name standardization
- Missing value and duplicate handling
- Feature engineering (e.g., ride duration, weekday)
- Basic data quality filtering
- Saves cleaned data to `data/cleaned/` as `.csv` and `.RDS`

### `02_bike_share_analysis.R`
Performs:

- Loading the cleaned dataset
- Descriptive statistics on ride behavior
- Visualizations:
  - Rides by day of week
  - Avg ride duration by user type
  - Rides by hour of day
  - Monthly usage trends

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

- `tidyverse` – data wrangling and visualization
- `lubridate` – working with dates and times
- `janitor` – clean column names
- `skimr` – quick data summaries
- `scales` – format plots nicely
- `here` – manage relative file paths cleanly

---

## 📈 Key Insights

1. **Casual vs. Member Ride Duration**  
   Casual riders tend to have significantly longer average ride durations.

2. **Usage by Day of the Week**  
   Casual riders prefer weekends; members show weekday commuting patterns.

3. **Peak Ride Times**  
   Most rides occur during late afternoons and early evenings.

4. **Monthly Trends**  
   Summer months see the highest usage, especially among casual riders.

## ▶️ How to Run the Analysis

### 📦 Prerequisites

Install required R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "janitor", "skimr", "scales", "here"))
```

### 🚀 Steps

1. **Run `01_load_and_combine_data.R`** to:
   - Load, clean, and preprocess the data
   - Engineer useful features like `ride_length`, `day_of_week`, and `month`
   - Save the cleaned dataset in `data/cleaned/` as both `.csv` and `.RDS`

2. **Run `02_bike_share_analysis.R`** to:
   - Load the cleaned dataset
   - Perform descriptive statistical analysis
   - Generate visualizations and save them in the `charts/` directory

---

## Files and Folders

- `data/raw/` — raw CSV files  
- `data/cleaned/` — cleaned datasets  
- `scripts/` — R scripts for cleaning and analysis  
- `charts/` — output images  
- `README.md` — project overview

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

This case study demonstrates how R can be used to:

- Clean and prepare large datasets
- Perform effective exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Create impactful visualizations
- Communicate insights in a reproducible, transparent way

The findings can help Cyclistic (or similar bike-share companies) improve marketing strategies, resource allocation, and user engagement by better understanding rider behavior patterns.
